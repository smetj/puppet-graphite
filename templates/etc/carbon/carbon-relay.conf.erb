# This is a list of carbon daemons we will send any relayed or
# generated metrics to. The default provided would send to a single
# carbon-cache instance on the default port. However if you
# use multiple carbon-cache instances then it would look like this:
#
# DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 127.0.0.1:2104:b
#
# The general form is IP:PORT:INSTANCE where the :INSTANCE part is
# optional and refers to the "None" instance if omitted.
#
# Note that if the destinations are all carbon-caches then this should
# exactly match the webapp's CARBONLINK_HOSTS setting in terms of
# instances listed (order matters!).
